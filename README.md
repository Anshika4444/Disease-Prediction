# Disease-Prediction
Predicting diseases at an early stage is crucial for timely medical intervention and treatment. Machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes can be used to make predictions based on historical data and patient information.
This repository provides a simple implementation of disease prediction using the Naive Bayes algorithm. You can use this code as a starting point for building more advanced disease prediction systems or for educational purposes.

## Features
Disease prediction based on input features.
Easy-to-use Python code.
Well-documented code for understanding and customization.
